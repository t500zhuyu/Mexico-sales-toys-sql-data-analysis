This a data analysis exercise where I answer the following questions:
 - Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
 - Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
 - Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
 - How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
In this SQL script I use different queries and use different methods:
 * Join tables
 * math operations to create and consult new columns
 * Update
 * Group by
 * Order by
Besides I also analysis the original files to find and clean any issues (data cleaning, change format numbers, search for blank rows).
